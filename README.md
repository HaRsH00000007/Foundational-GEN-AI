ðŸ“œ Certification: Foundational Generative AI - iNeuron

I recently completed the Foundational Generative AI course by iNeuron, where I deepened my knowledge in generative AI and worked hands-on with assignments and quizzes to reinforce concepts. As a result of successfully completing all assignments and quizzes, I was awarded a certification.

Course Highlights:

Hands-on assignments focused on practical applications of Generative AI concepts.
Worked with Hugging Face models and used Llama 2 with Langchain for text generation.
Developed and implemented generative AI models for text generation and data retrieval tasks.

Skills Acquired:
LLMs and Generative AI: Understanding the architecture and applications of language models for generating coherent and context-aware text.
Hugging Face & Langchain: Leveraging these tools for deploying and fine-tuning models for various AI tasks.
Project-based learning: Completed practical assignments that mirror real-world AI challenges.
